## ⚡ Overview

**MiroFish** is a next-generation AI prediction engine powered by multi-agent technology. By extracting seed information from the real world (such as breaking news, policy drafts, or financial signals), it automatically constructs a high-fidelity parallel digital world. Within this space, thousands of intelligent agents with independent personalities, long-term memory, and behavioral logic freely interact and undergo social evolution. You can inject variables dynamically from a "God's-eye view" to precisely deduce future trajectories — **rehearse the future in a digital sandbox, and win decisions after countless simulations**.

> You only need to: Upload seed materials (data analysis reports or interesting novel stories) and describe your prediction requirements in natural language</br>
> MiroFish will return: A detailed prediction report and a deeply interactive high-fidelity digital world

### Our Vision

MiroFish is dedicated to creating a swarm intelligence mirror that maps reality. By capturing the collective emergence triggered by individual interactions, we break through the limitations of traditional prediction:

- **At the Macro Level**: We are a rehearsal laboratory for decision-makers, allowing policies and public relations to be tested at zero risk
- **At the Micro Level**: We are a creative sandbox for individual users — whether deducing novel endings or exploring imaginative scenarios, everything can be fun, playful, and accessible

From serious predictions to playful simulations, we let every "what if" see its outcome, making it possible to predict anything.

## 🧭 MiroFish v2 Evidence Pipeline Preview

MiroFish v2 adds a contained, demo-safe evidence pipeline alongside the existing Graphiti/OASIS workflow. It converts research documents into traceable stakeholder scenarios: upload or load a research pack, extract claims/entities/events, build a lightweight relationship graph, generate stakeholder agents, run multi-round simulations, score base/upside/downside cases, produce a cited Markdown forecast report, and answer follow-up questions against the source evidence and simulation logs.

```text
Research Pack
  -> Source Chunks with Stable IDs
  -> Claims / Entities / Events / Relationships
  -> Relationship Graph JSON
  -> Stakeholder Agents
  -> Multi-Round Simulation
  -> Scenario Scores
  -> Cited Forecast Report
  -> Follow-Up Q&A
```

### v2 Local Demo

The v2 demo works without paid API keys by using deterministic fallback extraction and simulation.

```bash
# Run from the project root with the existing backend venv
backend/.venv/bin/python backend/scripts/run_v2_demo.py
```

Example output:

```text
documents=1
claims=25
entities=40
relationships=100
agents=12
rounds=3
scores=3
report=backend/uploads/v2_runs/<run_id>/forecast_report.md
```

Each run also writes `state.json`, `graph.json`, `agents.json`, `simulation_rounds.json`, and `scenario_scores.json` in the same run folder.

You can also run it through the backend API after starting `npm run backend`:

```bash
curl http://localhost:5001/api/v2/demo
```

### v2 API

```text
POST /api/v2/run
POST /api/v2/research-pack
GET  /api/v2/demo
GET  /api/v2/runs/<run_id>
POST /api/v2/runs/<run_id>/resume
POST /api/v2/runs/<run_id>/question
GET  /api/v2/runs/<run_id>/report.md
```

Multipart upload example:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/v2/research-pack \
  -F "files=@test_inputs/v2_demo/fictional_restructuring_case.md" \
  -F "question=Forecast stakeholder reactions over the next 90 days" \
  -F "rounds=3"
```

JSON example:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/v2/run \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "project_name": "Inline Demo",
    "question": "What is the downside case?",
    "rounds": 3,
    "documents": [
      {
        "filename": "brief.md",
        "text": "Acme Corp announced a liquidity review. Horizon Bank requested monthly reporting."
      }
    ]
  }'
```

### v2 Environment Variables

The local v2 demo does not require external services. It uses uploaded or local research-pack documents and a deterministic fallback extractor so reviewers can run it without paid keys.

### v2 Limitations and Roadmap

- Current v2 extraction is heuristic so the demo can run without paid keys. It is traceable, but less nuanced than an LLM-backed extractor.
- Scenario probabilities are subjective model outputs, not objective truth.
- The v2 pipeline is currently additive and separate from the full OASIS social simulation path.
- Roadmap: LLM extraction adapters, frontend research-pack upload flow, evidence board, graph viewer, report export UI, and ensemble simulation runs.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Source Code Deployment (Recommended)

#### Prerequisites

| Tool | Version | Description | Check Installation |
|------|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Node.js** | 18+ | Frontend runtime, includes npm | `node -v` |
| **Python** | ≥3.11, ≤3.12 | Backend runtime | `python --version` |
| **uv** | Latest | Python package manager | `uv --version` |

#### 1. Configure Environment Variables

```bash
# Copy the example configuration file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit the .env file and fill in the required API keys
```

**Required Environment Variables:**

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
LLM_API_KEY=${OPENAI_API_KEY}
LLM_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1
LLM_MODEL_NAME=gpt-4o-mini

GRAPH_BACKEND=graphiti
GRAPHITI_DRIVER=falkordb
FALKORDB_HOST=localhost
FALKORDB_PORT=6379
GRAPHITI_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false
SEMAPHORE_LIMIT=3
```

`ZEP_API_KEY` is no longer needed. MiroFish now uses self-hosted Graphiti with OpenAI for LLM and embedding work.

#### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
# One-click installation of all dependencies (root + frontend + backend)
npm run setup:all
```

Or install step by step:

```bash
# Install Node dependencies (root + frontend)
npm run setup

# Install Python dependencies (backend, auto-creates virtual environment)
npm run setup:backend
```

The backend uses `uv sync` because Graphiti and OASIS currently disagree on the exact `neo4j` driver pin; the backend `pyproject.toml` contains a resolver override for this.

#### Local Graphiti Setup

Graphiti uses a local graph database. The default backend is FalkorDB.

```bash
# Start FalkorDB locally
docker run -p 6379:6379 -p 3002:3000 -it --rm falkordb/falkordb:latest

# Or use the compose helper profile
docker compose --profile graphiti up -d falkordb
```

FalkorDB exposes the Redis protocol on `6379` and the web UI on `3002`. The frontend uses `3000`.

#### 3. Start Services

```bash
# Start both frontend and backend (run from project root)
npm run dev
```

**Service URLs:**
- Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`
- Backend API: `http://localhost:5001`

**Start Individually:**

```bash
npm run backend   # Start backend only
npm run frontend  # Start frontend only
```

Run the Graphiti smoke test:

```bash
cd backend
uv run python scripts/test_graphiti_smoke.py
# or, if using pip/venv:
python scripts/test_graphiti_smoke.py
```

End-to-end test flow:

1. Upload a PDF/TXT/MD file.
2. Generate ontology.
3. Build graph.
4. Create simulation.
5. Prepare simulation.
6. Optionally run simulation.
7. Generate report.

### Option 2: Docker Deployment

```bash
# 1. Configure environment variables (same as source deployment)
cp .env.example .env

# 2. Pull image and start
docker compose up -d
```

Reads `.env` from root directory by default, maps ports `3000 (frontend) / 5001 (backend)`

> Mirror address for faster pulling is provided as comments in `docker-compose.yml`, replace if needed.
